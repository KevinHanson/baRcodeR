# baRcodeR 0.2.0

Bugs and Improvements: 

- will replace all underscores in text with dashes. Underscores are not specified in the encoding dictionary of `qcrode` and will throw errors.
- x_space and y_space, parameters used to position text on label, is now limited between 0 and 1 for easier use.

New Features:

- Specify the width and height of the label to account for gaps between labels both horizontally and vertically.
