Description: Tools to generate unique identifier codes and printable barcoded 
    labels for the management of biological samples. The creation of unique ID 
    codes and printable PDF files can be initiated by standard commands, user 
    prompts, or through a GUI addin for R Studio. Biologically informative codes
    can be included for hierarchically structured sampling designs.
